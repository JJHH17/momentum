# Project Goals
- Use Webpack to build and deploy project
- Utilize seperate files and display OOP procedures
- Allow user to create and manage projects, as well as sub-to do objects

# Project Overview
App allows user to build a parent project which is appended to the sidebar view.

Upon clicking the relevant project div, the project is expanded to the main page container.

The user is then able to create to do items, which are held within that particular project.

Items can be modified and/or deleted.

# Notes for consideration and future learnings:
- The main aim for this project was to utilize webpack, adding dynamic previewing.
- There wasn't an emphasis on styling or modal design.
- This can be enhanced further by locking view to modal (prevent user from clicking around when modal is opened).
- Attempted to prevent duplication of modals on page and preventing behaviour/bugs that may impact performance.
